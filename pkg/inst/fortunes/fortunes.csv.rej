 Rolf Turner: In the middle of a Saturday morning (in my Time Zone!) I send out a plea for help, and in just over 20 minutes my problem is solved!<x>I don't think you get service like that anywhere else. This R-help list is BLOODY AMAZING!<x>Spencer Graves: 'The sun never sets on the (former) British Empire.' Today, it never sets on R-Help.;Rolf Turner and Spencer Graves;NA;R-help;May 2005
 "As a general rule (subject to numerous exceptions, caveats, etc.):<x>1) it is programming and debugging time that most impacts 'overall' program execution time;<x>2) this is most strongly impacted by code readability and size (the smaller the better);<x>3) both of which are enhanced by modular construction and reuseability, which argues for avoiding inline code and using separate functions.<x>These days, I would argue that most of the time it is program clarity and correctness (they are related) that is the important issue, not execution speed.";Berton Gunter;in a discussion about parsing speed;R-help;May 2005

 Dave Lubbers: R 2.7.2 - the manual says configure, make, which is what I did. So I did read the manual and followed the directions. The manual is too terse to get me there.<x>Duncan Murdoch: You used the wrong tense. In referring to R 2.7.2, only past tenses are grammatically correct.

 On average, any data manipulation that can be described in a sentence or two of English can be programmed in one line in R. If you find yourself writing a long 'for' loop to do something that sounds simple, take a step back and research if an existing combination of functions can easily handle your request.;Erik Iverson;NA;R-help;June 2010
